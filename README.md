# html-stock-calc
A stock tracker written in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS

A clone of https://github.com/Francis-McKee/top-stock-calc (written in Python) made for use online. The program performs calculations based on user input to determine the top stock to purchase (with a focus for dividend investors).

The file [Encrypt.html](https://github.com/Francis-McKee/html-stock-calc/blob/main/encrypt.html) is the code from the HTML calculator but encrypted using [iWEBTOOL](http://web.archive.org/web/20130501062008/http://www.iwebtool.com/html_encrypter) so that the source code is harder to understand.
